    <h1 class="what">What is soccer?</h1>
    <p>Soccer is a team sport played by a team of 11 players against another team of 11 players on a field.

        The team has one designated goalkeeper and 10 outfield players. Outfield players are usually specialised
         in attacking or defending or both. A team is typically split into defenders, midfielders and forwards, though
          there is no restriction on players moving anywhere on the pitch.
        
        It is known as soccer in North America, but is called football in most of the rest of the world. Its full name is
         Association Football.</p>

          <h2 class="what">History of soccer</h2>
          <p>Records trace the history of soccer back more than 2,000 years ago to ancient China. Greece, Rome, and parts
               of Central America also claim to have started the sport; but it was England that transitioned soccer, or what
                the British and many other people around the world call “football,” into the game we know today.</p>
